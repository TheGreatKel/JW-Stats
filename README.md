# Statistical Study on Growth of Jehovah's Witnesses

This is a project to find insights on the growth of Jehovah's Witnesses since 1991 using Python Data Science Libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, &sk-learn). I used a Multiple Linear Regression model for predictions.

Please refer to the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb). You can also see all the graphs in the plots folder. Enjoy!
